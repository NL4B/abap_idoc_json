# abap_idoc_json
Convert idocs in to json format.

SAP IDOC has the possibility to send IDOCs in IDOC-XML format, but modern integration platforms are mostly working with JSON and limit the number of fields to only the needed ones. This solution converts an IDOC or IDOC-XML into IDOC-JSON format. And by providing a mapping table, the class can even can convert it into a Common Data Model JSON structure with limited fields.
